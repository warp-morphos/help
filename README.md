# Introduction

Help is an inline help tool for [MorphOS](http://www.morphos-team.net) Shell.

It's like *man* for [MorphOS](http://www.morphos-team.net).

# Features

- FULL documentation of 111 shell commands (MorphOS 1.4)
- Small howto on the Shell arguments
- Many examples included
- Search by name or domain
- Localization support

# Requirements

Any PowerPC computer running MorphOS 1.4+.

# Usage

Help understands the following arguments:

- **ALL**:  Displays a small description of all available commands
- **CMD**:  Displays a more complete description of the 'CMD' command
- **ARGS**: Displays MorphOS shell arguments HowTo
- **DOM**: Shows a complete description of all commands related to DOM ; DOM can be: SHELL, USB, PCI, GFX, AUDIO|SOUND, FILES|IO, REXX, TASKS, MISC, RESOURCES

# Examples

Show the full description of the dir command:

```
Help CMD=DIR
```

List every sound-related command:

```
Help DOM=AUDIO
```

> **NOTE:** If a string is given without the CMD nor DOM arguments, Help will first look for the command list and then the domain

```
MorphOS:> Help why
=> display the description of the Why command.
```

```
MorphOS:> Help shell
=> displays a list of the commands found in the 'Shell' domain.
```

# Building from sources

To build Help for MorphOS, you only need the MorphOS SDK, no other components are needed. Once configured, building Help is as simple as typing:

````
make
````

By default, make will invoke `ppc-morphos-gcc`: this can be configured in the makefile if needed.

# Background

This project started in September 2004.
I had it in mind for a long time but didn't start it
because I had some other projects in mind.

After having read a thread on some Amiga/MorphOS forum
where people were discussing a lack of such a tool for our
beloved OS, I said: "Ok, it's time to DO IT !"

After months of research, guesses (a lot of MorphOS commands
have extra options which are not documented anywhere
when compared with their AmigaOS equivalent), coding,
typing (the whole .cd file consists of no less than 1651 lines !),
I'm pleased to have documented almost all 111 shell commands :)
Only some undocumented arguments are missing.

# Thanks to

- Everyone who helped me (MDC, #morphos,...) on the documentation of all the commands.

- People sending spell errors and missing command args.
